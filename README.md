# StatisticalTests: StroopEffect

Statistics is a major component of data analysis. In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task and looked at the data collected from others and computed some statistics describing the results with Python. Finally, I interpreted the statistical test results in terms of my earlier hypotheses.

## About Stroop effect

The Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.
