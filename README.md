# StatisticalTests_StroopEffect

Statistics is a major component of data analysis. In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task and looked at the data collected from others and computed some statistics describing the results with Python. Finally, I interpreted the statistical test results in terms of my earlier hypotheses.
